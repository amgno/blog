# Projectors

**Difference between laser and lamp projector**

Laser projectors typically offer better brightness, color accuracy, and longer lifespan compared to lamp-based projectors. They require less maintenance, consume less power, and provide instant on/off.

**Maintance**

no bulbs to replace but cost more initially. Lasers still dim aver time, it's quite slower tho.

> laser projectors are unlike lamps in that they tend to work at something close to 100% of their initial brightness until the end of their life and then rapidly expire. The 20,000 hours is the expected minimum at full laser power, and yes, you will extend that if you run it at 75% or 50%, though it's not usually the simple calculation of doubling the hours at half-power.

2+- Years, of usage, which is more if you turn down the brightness.

**TK710** from `Benq 4k HDR 3200 ANSI` - 1400€ \

> Coming from an Optoma HD144x I’m really happy with the TK710’s performance. The picture is absolutely stunning. Colors have plenty of pop and the black levels are very good, especially considering the gamer focus of this projector. Looking at some HDR footage on YouTube I don’t feel like I’m really missing any color at all. I’m also loving the tiny border around the image inherent to DLP tech. The Optoma had a very wide border which always annoyed me.

*Looks like it's more tent to gamers then movie enthusiasts.*\
*Could be noisy.*\
*Lots of ppl happy with it.*

> * if you like the design, there's not really much competition
> * it's very compact, and in this space there are not many competitors that offer 500 lumens and 4k pixel shift. for example the xgimi horizon is twice as large, but still compact
> * the speakers are shit. you need to use a bluetooth speaker to actually get enjoyable sound out of it
> * it's basically only usable at night without any light, since it's very dark (as usual with those very compact beamers)

*Looks like speakers are the main problem as well as the brightness.*\
*Super compact, few ppl are saying that is not worth since at 1k there are better ones*

### Pixel shifting

Basically from the research I made it looks like most of the projectors are using a technology that performs something called Pixel shifting.

*What it is?*

From the looks of it it's a tech that most projectors use, that basically take a 1080p input then do some processing and make it look as detailed as a 2160p (4k) one. 

> The difference here is that native 4K projectors have roughly eight million distinct pixels on their panel to start off with, while pixel shifting tech starts with a lower number of pixels and creates the higher number by using the source image and processing it.

> If its a quality PJ and as long as its pixel shifting is 4X you wont be able to discern the difference.Its imperceivable.

> But there are some sneaky stuff going on out there.For example Epsons standard pixel shift is called 4K Enhanced. It doubles 1080p.But thats half as many pixels as you need for 4K.And they also do what they call Quad Phase in some of their PJs and those are 4X so its 4K.

> But, people place more emphasis on 4K than they should. Its resolution which isnt in the top 3 of what we percieve to be great images.What plays more of a role in our perceived images are color, contrast and saturation.

Unless you are going to pay more then 4000€ you are going to get Pixel shifting



### Worth?

Then is it really worth buying a projector from a movie enthusiast point of view, or at least someone that really enjoy watching and appreciating the looks of things.

Most likely no, if you are really stubborn and don't want to get a Pixel shift projector.

If you are down to have some compromises maybe yes, but at that point why not buy a native 4k TV, given that most likely even an OLED one is less pricy then a laser projector with pixel shifting.
